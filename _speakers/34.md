Arnaud JEAN (aka: John Wick), Developer Advocate with a particular set of skills!

By day, he's crafting killer demos and slaying documentation dragons. By night, he's a regular on the conference circuit, delivering and assisting to insightful talks. Before going rogue as a Developer Advocate, Arnaud was an AWS Solutions Architect â€“ a past that comes in handy more often than you'd think!
