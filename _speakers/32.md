I have been working in the field of computer science for over 15 years.

I am interested in all areas: DevSecOps, Software Craftmanship, Security, Agility, Method, Product etcâ€¦

I gained extensive experience because I had the opportunity to work for thirty different organizations.

In my last experiences, I was CTO, Coach, Head of a consulting department, speaker, trainer, facilitator and event organizer.

I have been a speaker for 2 years (Voxxed Days, DevOxx, DevFest Agile Tour, MixIt, JugSummerCamp, Sunny Tech, BDX.io, etc.)

Currently, I am passionate about speaking coaching. In 1 year and half, I have already accompanied several 32 people especially for the preparation of TEDX, School of Product, for the contest of Miss Aquitaine, Opening Keynotes and for the springboards of speakers of Craft Records.

This year, I accompagny the Craft Records association and Women In Tech Bordeaux. Since May, I challenge myself to coach a team of coaches for speaking for the "Tremplin des speakers Bordeaux"
